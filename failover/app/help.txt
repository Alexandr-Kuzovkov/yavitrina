Monitoring cron jobs
=========================

How it works.
---------------
For each cron job assign unique slug.
Then create job in Dashboard (http://40.118.41.25/failover/newjob) with this unique slug, description and max interval.
When cron job complete work, it send HTTP request to URL:

    http://40.118.41.25/failover/jobping/<job-unique-slug>

Failover store time of this ping. If failover did not receve request from cron task in max interval,
job will markes as died and notification will send to slack.
In dasboard you can create, edit, delete jobs.

Also cron job can send error message to URL:

    http://40.118.41.25/failover/joberror/<job-unique-slug>

Allowed methods are GET, POST
Parameter "message" with error message is required as GET or POST parameter.
Error will store in local database and will send to slack once.
You can see and delete errors in dashboard.
